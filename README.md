# Project 1: Movie Trailer Website

Python codes are prepared so that a list of movie information (e.g. titles, movie trailer URLs, etc.) are stored, and then a website containing those information is generated for users to review the movies and watch the trailers.

Requirement:
  - Python is installed
  - Internet is connected
  - The files are downloaded and unzipped

Steps to use the codes:
  - Open and edit “entertainment_center.py” for each movie, with information with order including:
      - Title
      - Year released
      - Poster image’s URL
      - Movie trailer’s URL
      - (Optional) A short description
  - If you have your own poster images, place them in the folder “photos”
  - Save and close the file “entertainment_center.py”
  - Go to the directory storing the file “entertainment_center.py” by a terminal
  - Run the file “entertainment_center.py”
    (e.g. type “python entertainment_center.py” in the terminal)
  - A website with defaulted name “fresh_tomatoes.html” should be generated and opened

Note:
  - If the images cannot be loaded, please ensure that the URL is provided correctly and the images (if necessary) are placed in the folder “photos”
  - If the trailer cannot be loaded, please ensure that the URL is provided correctly and your computer is allowed to play the youtube clips. (Sometimes the clips cannot be played due to legal reasons e.g. dispute in copyright)
